What's next
===========
For the next `0.7` release, at least the following features are planned:

1. **Projects system**. You'll be able to create projects and open them wherever they're.

2. **Building the project**. You'll be able to build your project as a final game.

3. **New file format**. Implement a new file format for all the assets. It'll be an optimized format for the engine to use.

Rendering
=========
Here you'll find everything you need to know about the rendering API of the engine and what features it supports.
In its core, the rendering system uses Vulkan API and it is designed with extensibility in mind.

To change renderer settings in the editor, checkout this :ref:`page <renderer_settings>`.
Or if you want to access them through C# scripts, learn about it :ref:`here <csharp_rendering_guide>`.

To learn more about the renderer itself, check out these pages:

PBR
===
`Physically based rendering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering>`_ is a rendering technique that is based on the theory that approximately matches the physics of light in the real world.
That makes it more accurate and photo-realistic if compared to older techniques.

This implementation of PBR is based on metalness and roughness workflows that allow you to control how metal-like and rough the surface should look like.
You can control the appearance of a surface by using :ref:`Materials <materials>`.
